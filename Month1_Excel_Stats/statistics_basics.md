# Day 1 – Introduction to Statistics

## What I learned

- Mean: We calculate the average of all measurements.

- Median: It is the middle number after sorting it in ascending order.
- Mode: Mode is the most repeted value.
- Standard Deviation: SD refers how spread out the data isfrom the average.
  Small SD → values are close to the average
  Large SD → values are far from the average

- Numerical Data: Written in numbers and used for calculations, If you can count or measure in numbers, it's a numerical data.
- Categorical Data: Data that is grouped together into categories or labels, It tells what type and not how much.

## Real-life example

Example: Marks of students

- Mean shows: 3+19+24+21+9 / 5 = 15.2, So 15.2 is the mean.
- Median shows: 3+9+19+21+24 , Here the median is 19 which is in the middle
- Standard Deviation shows: Simple Real-Life Example 2: Daily Walking Steps
  Person A:
  5000, 5100, 4900, 5050, 4950
  Very similar values → low SD

  Person B:
  1000, 9000, 3000, 8000, 2000
  Very different values → high SD

  So SD shows how regular your routine is.


# Day 2 – Data Types and Standard Deviation
## Numerical Data
Numerical data is data that is in numbers and can be used in calculations.

Examples:
- Marks: 45, 60, 78
- Temperature: 25°C, 30°C
- Salary: 20000, 35000

Types:
- Discrete: whole numbers (students count)
- Continuous: decimal values (height, weight)

## Categorical Data
Categorical data is data that shows categories or labels.

Examples:
- Gender: Male, Female
- City: Pune, Mumbai
- Grade: A, B, C

Types:
- Nominal: No order (colors, cities)
- Ordinal: Ordered (ratings, grades)

---

## Standard Deviation
Standard deviation shows how spread out the data is from the average.

Low SD → values are close to mean  
High SD → values are far from mean

## Real-life Example

Marks Set A: 50, 51, 49, 50, 50  
Marks Set B: 20, 40, 60, 80, 100  

Both can have same mean, but:
- Set A has low standard deviation
- Set B has high standard deviation

This shows consistency vs variability.

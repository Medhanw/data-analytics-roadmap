# Day 1 – Introduction to Statistics

## What I learned

- Mean: We calculate the average of all measurements.

- Median: It is the middle number after sorting it in ascending order.
- Mode: Mode is the most repeted value.
- Standard Deviation: SD refers how spread out the data isfrom the average.
  Small SD → values are close to the average
  Large SD → values are far from the average

- Numerical Data: Written in numbers and used for calculations, If you can count or measure in numbers, it's a numerical data.
- Categorical Data: Data that is grouped together into categories or labels, It tells what type and not how much.

## Real-life example

Example: Marks of students

- Mean shows: 3+19+24+21+9 / 5 = 15.2, So 15.2 is the mean.
- Median shows: 3+9+19+21+24 , Here the median is 19 which is in the middle
- Standard Deviation shows: Simple Real-Life Example 2: Daily Walking Steps
  Person A:
  5000, 5100, 4900, 5050, 4950
  Very similar values → low SD

  Person B:
  1000, 9000, 3000, 8000, 2000
  Very different values → high SD

  So SD shows how regular your routine is.

# Day 2 – Data Types and Standard Deviation

## Numerical Data

Numerical data is data that is in numbers and can be used in calculations.

Examples:

- Marks: 45, 60, 78
- Temperature: 25°C, 30°C
- Salary: 20000, 35000

Types:

- Discrete: whole numbers (students count)
- Continuous: decimal values (height, weight)

---

## Categorical Data

Categorical data is data that shows categories or labels.

Examples:

- Gender: Male, Female
- City: Pune, Mumbai
- Grade: A, B, C

Types:

- Nominal: No order (colors, cities)
- Ordinal: Ordered (ratings, grades)

---

## Standard Deviation

Standard deviation shows how spread out the data is from the average.

Low SD → values are close to mean  
High SD → values are far from mean

## Real-life Example

Marks Set A: 50, 51, 49, 50, 50  
Marks Set B: 20, 40, 60, 80, 100

Both can have same mean, but:

- Set A has low standard deviation
- Set B has high standard deviation

This shows consistency vs variability.

# Day 3 – Excel Basics

## What I learned

- Rows run horizontally
- Columns run vertically
- A cell is the intersection of row and column
- Excel stores numerical and categorical data

## Formulas used

- SUM()
- AVERAGE()
- COUNT()
- MAX()
- MIN()

## Why Excel is important

Excel is used to:

- Store data
- Clean data
- Analyze basic patterns

# Day 4 – Excel Sorting, Filtering & Formatting

## What I learned

- Sorting arranges data in order (ascending/descending)
- Filtering shows only selected data
- Conditional formatting highlights important values

## Why this is important

These tools help:

- Find top performers
- Identify weak areas
- Clean and analyze large datasets faster

## Tasks I performed

- Sorted marks highest to lowest
- Filtered students by city and grade
- Highlighted high and low marks using colors

# Day 5 – Excel IF Function and Insights

## What I learned

- IF function helps in decision making
- Syntax: IF(condition, value_if_true, value_if_false)
- Nested IF handles multiple conditions

## Formulas used

- =IF(B2>=60,"Pass","Fail")
- =IF(B2>=85,"Excellent",IF(B2>=70,"Good","Needs Improvement"))

## Insights from data

- Students with marks below 60 need improvement
- Conditional logic helps automate evaluation

# Day 6 – Excel Charts and Data Summary

## Charts created

- Column chart for student marks
- Pie chart for grade distribution
- City-wise performance chart

## Why charts are important

Charts help:

- Understand data faster
- Communicate insights clearly
- Support business decisions

## Insights from charts

- Highest performer: Pune
- Most common grade: B & C
- City with better average performance: Pune is consistant, Delhi needs improvement.

# Week 1 Mini Project – Student Performance Analysis

## Objective

To analyze student performance using Excel and basic statistical concepts.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains:

- Student names
- Marks
- City
- Grade

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel
- Basic statistics
- Excel formulas and charts

## Analysis Performed

- Calculated average, max, and min marks
- Identified pass and fail students using IF
- Sorted and filtered data for insights
- Visualized data using charts

## Key Insights

- Top performing student(s): **\_\_**
- Average class performance: **\_\_**
- Majority grade: **\_\_**
- City with better performance: **\_\_**

## Conclusion

Excel helps in converting raw data into meaningful insights for decision-making.

# Day 15 – Introduction to Python for Data Analytics

## What is Python?

Python is a programming language used for:

- Data analysis
- Automation
- Machine learning
- Visualization

## Why analysts use Python

- Handles large datasets
- Automates repetitive tasks
- Performs advanced calculations

## Basic concepts learned

- Variables store data
- Python supports multiple data types
- print() displays output

# Day 16 – Python Variables, Input & Operations

## What I learned

- Variables store data in Python
- input() takes user input
- int() converts text to numbers

## Arithmetic Operators

- - Addition
- - Subtraction
- - Multiplication
- / Division

## Why this is important for analytics

Python can automate calculations and handle large datasets efficiently.

# Day 17 – Python IF Statements

## What I learned

- IF statements help make decisions in Python
- Indentation is required
- elif handles multiple conditions

## Syntax

if condition:
action
elif condition:
action
else:
action

## Why this matters in analytics

IF statements automate decision-making such as:

- Pass/fail classification
- Customer segmentation
- Performance evaluation

# Day 18 – Python Loops

## Why loops are needed

Loops automate repetitive tasks and reduce manual coding.

## Types of loops

1. For loop – used when number of repetitions is known
2. While loop – used when condition controls repetition

## Syntax Example

for i in range(5):
print(i)

## Why loops matter in analytics

Loops help:

- Process large datasets
- Perform repeated calculations
- Automate data cleaning tasks
